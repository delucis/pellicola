## Documentation

`pellicola` provides a simple way to generate video files from animations written using the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API), except that it runs in Node.js, avoiding the need to open your animation in a browser window. This enables you to programmatically generate video files from the command line or a Node.js server for example.

The following documentation is still a work in progress, but will hopefully help you get started.
